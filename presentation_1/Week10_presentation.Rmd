# Introduction


---
# Research aims and	questions

__The overall research aim is to provide probabilistic estimates of the cause of fire ignition for the 2019-2020 bushfires.__ 
--

1. Using satellite hotspots data can we detect ignition time and location? 
--

2. Can data from other sources including vegetation, weather, proximity to road and recreation site help to inform ignition type?
--

3. How do the characteristics of 2019-2020 bushfires compare to historical bushfires?
--

4. Can we make a useful model for the fire risk across Australia? What predictors including fire indexes, proximity to road and recreation site, weather and vegetation are useful for modelling fire risk?
