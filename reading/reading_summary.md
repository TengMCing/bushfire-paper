# Thoughts & Notes

1. A new tidy data structure to support exploration and modeling of temporal data

	Problem: inconsistent formats of wild temporal data

	Inspiration: tidy data workflow proposed by Wickham and Grolemund 

    Package: tsibble

    A new type of data structure

    Fields: index key measurements

    index + key = PK

    index: explicit

    Automatically check PK when construct a tsibble 

    Interval selection: 
    	a. Compute GCD as fixed interval
    	b. irregular interval
    	c. unknown interval

    provide tools for handling missing value 
    adopt dplyr's tools and modify for ts data

    A workflow for dealing with temporal data 
    Can be used in the project to improve the workflow

2. Enabling interactivity on displays of multivariate time series and longitudinal data
