# Abstract {-}

Debate about whether lightning or arson was the cause of the devastating 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, was fierce on social media. To study the cause of the recent fires, we collate data on historical bushfire origins, proximity to roads, campsites, CFA stations, leading weather conditions, vegetation types, along with new remotely sensed hotspot data. We develop a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm to detect bushfire ignitions from hotspot data. A random forest model, classifying cause, is trained on the historical data, and used to predict the cause of the 2019-2020 ignitions. The model, primarily using distance from roads, CFA stations and wind to achieve overall accuracy of 75% (91% for lightning). Lightning is the predicted cause in 82% of the recent Victorian fires, with arson at just 4%. The analysis using open data and open source software, is available to help fire authorities monitor and investigate future bushfire risk and causes.

*Key words: machine learning, statistics, spatio-temporal data, cluster analysis, exploratory data analysis*
