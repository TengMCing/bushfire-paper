# Abstract {-}

The 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season was a devastating crisis. Debate about whether lightning or arson was the cause of the bushfires was fierce on social media. We developed a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm to detect the time and locations of bushfire ignitions in Victoria during the 2019-2020 season from the new available Himawari-8 hotspot data. The historical bushfire origins data over 2000-2018 was used to train a random forest model to classify the cause. The final model showed good predictive ability with 74.95% overall accuracy, and 90.5% accuracy in lightning-caused bushfires. The model predicted the major cause of estimated 2019-2020 bushfire ignitions in Victoria was lightning (82%), with arson responsible for just 3.62% of the total fires. The clustering algorithm and the predictive model developed in this research could help fire authorities to more readily monitor and investigate bushfire risk and causes using satellite hotpot data.
