## Data Sources

A focus of this work is to utilise open-source data, and collates these datasets to provide a data fusion with which to tackle the research questions. The motivating data source is satellite hotspots, which is different from what have been analysed previously in the literature. This data is collated with weather records, fuel layer, location of roads, fire stations and recreation sites, and causes of historical fire ignitions. The spatial and temporal details of each dataset are provided in Table \ref{tab:datasetinfo}. In addition, the original data types of each dataset are provided in Table \ref{tab:datatype}. In both tables, there is an `Index` column indicate the dataset usage, which will be further discussed in section [3.1.8][Summary of dataset usage]. 

### Satellite hotspot data

To track bushfires in Australia remotely with high temporal and spatial resolution, we used hotspot data taken from the Himawari-8 satellite [@jaxa]. The hotspot data was available on the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency FTP site. Only the data from October 2019 to March 2020 was downloaded. Details on how to download this data were provided by @hotspots. The dataset contained records of 1989572 hotspots for 6 months in the full disk of 140 Â°east longitude.

### Climate data

To better understand bushfires, we collected climate data from Bureau of Meteorology (**BOM**) and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (**CSIRO**). Weather properties including maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall and solar exposure were retrieved via an open-source R package `bomrang` [@R-bomrang], which was a data client of **BOM**. Historical weather records of 885 weather stations across Australia from January 1863 to April 2020 were downloaded. However, the number of publicly available climate attributes on **BOM** were limited. In order to maintain the coherent reproducible workflows, we decided to download near-surface wind speed grids across Australia from January 1975 to December 2018 from **CSIRO** [@wind] and the weather station-based wind speed from January 2017 to August 2020 from the Australia Automated Surface Observing System (**ASOS**) network mirrored by Iowa State University [@windasos]. There were only a limited number of **ASOS** stations in Victoria and they mostly based around Melbourne. Therefore, even though **ASOS** data was also available over 2000-2018, **CSIRO** data was used.

### Road map

Since bushfires could be impacted by anthropogenic factors, we used road map from a comprehensive open-source map **Openstreetmap** [@OpenStreetMap] to represent the reachability of bushfire ignition locations. The road map was one of the layers of the full archive, which consisted of 1797217 roads belonging to 27 different road classes in Australia. 

### Fuel layer

Vegetation information was obtained by using a 2018 nationwide forest dataset compiled by @forest. This was the fifth and the latest national State of the Forest Report (**SOFR**). Previous national **SOFR**s were published in 1998-2013 and were superseded.

### Fire stations

Data of Country Fire Authority (**CFA**) fire stations were retrieved from @cfa. It contained 52716 Victorian topographic features including rivers, water bodies, transport, facilities and fire stations.

### Recreation sites

Camping activities could be associated with accidental human-caused bushfires. Therefore, we downloaded Victorian recreation sites from @recreation. The dataset contained 417 camping locations in Victoria. 

### Fire origins

We used the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (**DELWP**) Fire Origins dataset to obtain historical bushfire ignition locations and causes [-@fireorigin]. This dataset provided first reported location of the fire recorded by crews rather than the exact origin of the fire, which could be considered as a great approximation of ignition points. 


### Summary of dataset usage

In Table \ref{tab:datasetinfo} and Table \ref{tab:datatype}, column `Index` indicates different usage for datasets in this research. `1` is the satellite hotspot data, `2` is the wind speed data retrieved from **ASOS**, `3` are supplementary datasets and `4` is the historical ignition data.

`1` is used in spatio-temporal clustering algorithm to identify ignition location and time. `3` combined with `4` are used as training, validation and test set to build a bushfire ignition classifier. `2` and `3` combined with the clustering results are used as predictors to predict the cause of bushfire ignition of 2019-2020 bushfires. 

The summary of dataset usage and research workflow is provided in Figure \ref{fig:datasummary}.

## Data processing for historical bushfire ignitions


The programming language we used to perform data manipulation in this research was `R` [@R]. Victorian historical fire origins, recreation sites, **CFA** fire stations and road map were geospatial data in the shapefile format, which could be processed using the tools in `sf` [@R-sf]. Fuel layer and near-surface wind speed were also geospatial data but stored in the grid format. We used tools in `raster` [@R-raster] to manipulate the data. Other datasets including satellite hotspot data and **BOM** climate data were stored in csv format which could be handled using the package `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse].

We only kept historical fire origins since 2000 due to the limitation of other supplementary datasets. We dropped all cases with unknown cause from the dataset under the assumption that the major causes distributed in a same way in cases with unknown cause. Given the dataset contained fires other than bushfires, we dropped non-bushfire cases based on their cause. Fires caused by reasons included "WASTE DISPOSAL", "BURNING BUILDING" and "BURNING VEHICLE" were not considered as bushfires. Causes of fire were then recategorized into 5 classes, including lightning, accident, arson, burning off and others.  We ended up having very few cases in others (0.9%) which motivated us to drop it.

**BOM** weather records including maximum temperature, minimum temperature, solar exposure and rainfall were station-based data. Weather stations distributed unevenly across Victoria and were often under maintenance. Therefore, we matched every historical fire origin to its 10 nearest weather stations, and then extracted the nearest non-missing daily weather metrics. Differently, **CSIRO** wind speed data provided us with a full grid of values in Victoria. Therefore, we projected each historical fire origin onto its corresponding gird entry to extract the daily average wind speed. Finally, weather metrics in the past 720 days for every historical fire origin were summarised into several numeric variables which can be found in Appendix.

Besides, **CFA** stations locations were filtered from the raw data by matching the `FEATSUBTYP` field equal to "fire station". Natural logarithm of the distance to the nearest recreation site, fire station and road were computed for every historical fire origin.

Vegetation information included vegetation type, height and cover were stored in the grid format which was extracted in the same way as the **CSIRO** wind speed data. 

We also truncated hotspot data by using a recommended threshold of fire power [@hotspots], which was over 100 (irradiance over 100 watts per square metre), to reduce noise from the background, and then selected the hotspots within the boundary of Victoria. The further steps of data processing for hotspot data including clustering and joining with other covariates will be introduced in chapter \ref{ch:STHC}.




## Compiled data

The end results of the data cleaning were two different datasets. One was the compiled dataset used for model fitting which contained 9369 observations and 55 fields, including a field represented the cause of the bushfire ignition. The other one was the satellite hotspot data that were ready for clustering, which contained 75936 observations and 4 fields. These 4 fields were unique identifier, longitude, latitude and time.

Covariates for fitting the ignition classifier included month, day, day of the week, longitude , latitude, forest type, forest crown cover, forest height, rainfall in the past 2 years, wind speed in the past 2 years, temperature in the past 2 years, solar exposure in the past 2 years, natural logarithm of proximity to the nearest fire station, recreation site and road. Additional details about the covariate information can be found in Appendix. 


## Exploratory data analysis of historical bushfire ignitions

By performing the exploratory data analysis on the historical bushfire ignitions, we explored the relationship between covariates and causes of ignition.

From January 2000 to December 2018, Victoria recorded 3886, 3173, 1627 and 683 bushfire ignitions caused by lightning, accident, arson and burning off respectively. The histogram of ignition cause is given in (A) of Figure \ref{fig:causehist}. The proportion of each cause was against the review of bushfires proposed by @beale2011preventing. Ignitions caused by arson were significantly less than the data provided in their review, while lightning-caused ignitions taking a greater percentage. 

There was an abnormal trend of accident-caused ignition over the recent years which is shown in the (B) of Figure \ref{fig:causehist}. In addition, from (C) of Figure \ref{fig:causehist}, we found that lightning-caused ignitions were most likely occurred in January and February, which were the hottest months in Victoria. It indicated that lightning-caused ignitions were related to temperature. Moreover, according to (D) of Figure \ref{fig:causehist}, people were careless in managing fire risk on Sunday and in the first two days of the week.

![Histogram (A) and bar plots of four different casues of historical fire ignitions in Victoria by year (B), month (C) and day of the week (D). (A) Lightning and accident were the two main sources of bushfire ignitions, which took up 41% and 34% respectively. Proportion of ignitions caused by arson was around 17%. 7% of ignitions were reported as planned burns. (B) Accident-caused ignitions increased significantly since 2012. Meanwhile, there were only few cases in 2011, which was because 2011-2012 bushfire season mainly affected Western Australia instead of Victoria. (C) January was the most serious month in the bushfire season throughout these years. Besides, lightning-caused ignitions usually occurred in the hottest months. (D) Ignitions were almost equally likely to occur on every day of the week. However, accident-caused ignitions were more often on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. \label{fig:causehist}](figures/overall_summary.png){width=560 height=420}

In Figure \ref{fig:twod}, lightning-caused ignitions were more likely to occur in the mountain area of Victoria and human-caused ignitions were closer to the urban area. It suggested that spatial pattern might be useful in ignition classification.

![2D density plot of historical bushfire ignitions. The density plot shows arson and accident-caused ignitions were different from each other. Accident-caused ignitions were denser. In addition, lightning-caused ignitions were less likely to occur in Melbourne metropolitan area. \label{fig:twod}](figures/lon_lat.png){width=560 height=420}

According to the density plot of 1-year average wind speed shown in the upper left of Figure \ref{fig:aws_m12}, the slower yearly wind speed was an indicator of lightning-caused ignitions in contrast to ignitions caused by other sources. In the upper right of the same figure, we found that lightning-caused ignitions were far from the nearest fire station and arson-caused ignitions were closer to the nearest fire station. It was potentially because the population density around the fire station was larger. Besides, lightning-caused ignitions were less reachable shown in the bottom right of the Figure \ref{fig:aws_m12}. Moreover, in the bottom left of the figure, accident-caused ignitions were significantly close to camping sites, which suggests that camp fire was a source of bushfire ignitions.

![Density plot of 1-year average wind speed (Upper left), log distance to the nearest CFA station (Upper right), log distance to the nearest recreation site (Bottom left) and log distance to the nearest road (Bottom right). (Upper left) Wind speed was one of the key factor to classify different types of bushfire ignitions. Lightning-caused ignitions were more likely to occur in windless years. (Upper right) Arson-caused ignitions were closer to fire stations. In contrast, lightning-caused ignitions were far from the fire stations since they were often occurred in the mountain area. (Bottom left) Accident-caused ignitions were very likely to be camp fire. (Bottom right) Lightning-caused ignitions were significantly less reachable, which could cause difficulties to fight them.  \label{fig:aws_m12}](figures/overall_density.png){width=560 height=420}
