# Conclusion {#ch:conclusion}

I will list the main points here (will be finished in the next 2 weeks). The conclusion will be brief given I have mentioned some of them in the contribution.

1. We predicted the cause of 2019-2020 bushfire, which showed the main cause.
2. The model can be used for any past or future ignition to predict cause, given the covariates are easily accessible
3. We developed an algorithm to reconstruct bushfire from hotspot data
4. Combine (1) and (3), it is a complete workflow to detect new ignition and predict the cause. This workflow can be smoothly adopted by others including CFA staff.
