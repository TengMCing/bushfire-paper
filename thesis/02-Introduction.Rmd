# Introduction {#ch:introduction}

## Motivation

In Australia, bushfires have historically caused massive loss of property and life. Since the 1967 Hobart bushfires, the insurance claims for building losses were greater than 10 million Australia dollars [@mcaneney2009100]. <!-- McAneney, Chen and Pitman (2009) show in their research that the average number of buildings had been destroyed by bushfire per year is 84, accounting for 20% of total building losses in hazard events.--> The 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, compared with other major bushfires in history, had a more devastating impact on the environment and properties.  According to a report by @LisaRichardsNigelBrew2020, published by the Parliament of Australia, 3094 houses were destroyed and over 17M hectares of land burned. These two figures are the highest in history. Fortunately, fewer lives were lost: 33 (including firefighters) compared to 173 in the Black Saturday fires and 47 in Ash Wednesday fires [@LisaRichardsNigelBrew2020].

The research is also motivated by the lack of knowledge about the cause of bushfire in Australia. @beale2011preventing state in their research that the cause is only known for 58.9% of fires. Historically, about 50% are due to deliberate and suspicious ignitions, 35% by accidents and 6% by natural, such as lightning. Understanding the cause of the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires is a crucial step to provide information for future policy and fire risk management.

## Aims

This research explore the potential methods of fire ignition during 2019-2020 Australia bushfires season based on the new availability of satellite data, and provide a model to predict the fire risk for locations around the country. Satellite data provides the opportunity to more objectively study ignition locations, particularly in less accessible regions.

The overall research aim is to provide probabilistic estimates of the cause of fire ignition for the 2019-2020 bushfires. Several smaller research questions that being addressed are:

  1. Using satellite hotspots data can we detect ignition time and location? 
  2. How do the characteristics of 2019-2020 bushfires compare to historical bushfires?
  3. Can data from other sources including vegetation, weather, proximity to road and recreation sites help to inform ignition type?
  4. Can we make a useful model for the fire risk across Australia? What predictors including fire indexes, proximity to road and recreation site, weather and vegetation are useful for modelling fire risk?
