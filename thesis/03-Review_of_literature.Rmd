## Spatio-temporal clustering

To detect ignition time and location of a bushfire from satellite hotspot data, hotspots need to be grouped according to its location and time into meaningful clusters. This can be performed by spatio-temporal clustering.

Spatio-temporal data contain at least 3 dimensions which are locations and time. @kisilevich2009spatio in their survey of spatio-temporal clustering algorithms summarised that there were 5 types of point-wise spatio-temporal data, including spatio-temporal events, geo-referenced variable, geo-referenced time series, moving points and trajectories. Table \ref{tab:st} shows that the classification was based on the temporal dimension and the spatial dimension. 

(ref:sttable) A classification of spatio-temporal point-wise data types [@kisilevich2009spatio]

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
data.frame(single = c("Spatio-temporal events", ""), updated = c("Geo-referenced variable", "Moving points"), time = c("Geo-referenced time series", "Trajectories")) %>%
  `rownames<-`(c('Fixed locatoin', 'Dynamic location')) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "latex", 
               col.names = c("Single snapshot", "Updated snapshot", "Time series"),
               label = 'st',
               caption = "(ref:sttable)",
               booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down"))
```

Meanwhile in satellite hotspots clustering, the data type is even more complicated which by definition in @kisilevich2009spatio's work, each moving object possesses a spatial extension with arbitrary size and shape. 

Before performing the clustering algorithm on spatio-temporal data, deciding how to represent the temporal information in a high-dimensional space is challenging [@kisilevich2009spatio]. It is because the end result of the clustering algorithm can be highly sensitive to the temporal resolution. Hence, scaling of the temporal dimension is vary by application.

In the late '90s, researchers in the University of Munich proposed an influential density-based algorithm for discovering clusters [@ester1996density]. @ester1996density mentioned 3 difficulties in clustering algorithm which motivated their work: (1) Requirements of domain knowledge to determine the hyperparameters, (2) Arbitrary shape of clusters and (3) Computation efficiency. 

According to the Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (**DBSCAN**) algorithm, they defined a maximum radius $\epsilon$ to construct densities around each point, which were spheres in the case of 3-dimensional space. Besides, to overcome the impact of noise, at least minimum number of points (`MinPts`) would be contained by the sphere. Finally, intersected spheres would be considered belonging to the same cluster. 

The time complexity of **DBSCAN** is $O(N log(N))$. More impressively, this algorithm only needs $O(N)$ memory. They have also shown that via visualizing the density of distance to the k-th nearest neighbour from each point, optimal $\epsilon$ and `MinPts` could be chosen.
 
Although **DBSCAN** is popular in other fields, it is not suitable for clustering hotspots data. First, it doesn’t address the issue of defining the scaling of the temporal dimension. Second, the behaviour of bushfire have not been taken into account. The **DBSCAN** algorithm assumes the clustering rules work for both directions of the timeline, omitting the fact that bushfire evolves by time.

A better algorithm for satellite hotspots clustering is Fire Spread Reconstruction (**FSR**) [@loboda2007reconstruction]. This algorithm starts from the earliest observed hotspot. It constructs a tree based on three rules, (1) the earliest observed hotspot is the root of the tree, (2) any node is within the 2.5km radius from its parent and (3) any node is observed no later than 4 days from its parent. When the tree is closed and there are still unassigned hotspots, the algorithm will continue at the earliest unassigned hotspot to construct a new tree. Finally, each tree is a cluster, and the earliest hotspot will be defined as the ignition point.

**FSR** works well in reconstructing bushfire spread, but it constructs clusters sequentially. If two fires starts at a different location but had overlapping coverage, **FSR** will consider they are a single fire when their fronts meet with each other. In this situation, one of the fires will be smaller in scale and shorter in time, which can not correctly reflect the real state of bushfire. Besides, @loboda2007reconstruction didn’t provide the detail of parameter tuning in their research. Instead, they briefly delivered the reason for choosing 4 days as the time threshold, which was because they wanted to tolerant missed observation due to could and smoke cover.

**DBSCAN** is mature and efficient, and has a parameter tuning tool, but is not suitable for temporal data like satellite hotspot data. **FSR** is designed for satellite hotspot data but lacks of detail consideration. Inspired by these two algorithms, our work is to design a spatio-temporal algorithm that can efficiently and robustly cluster hotspots with respect to the temporal behaviour of bushfire. Meanwhile, we need to provide a tool to help make parameter choices.


## Bushfire modelling

Existing research on bushfire modelling can be divided into two main categories: simulation and analytical modelling. 

In simulation modelling, @keane2004classification developed landscape fire succession models (LFSMs) to simulate spatial fire behaviour, including fire ignition and fire spread, and accounting for fire and vegetation dynamics. @bradstock2012wildfires used a model called **FIRESCAPE** which involved simulating fire behaviours with fuel and weather conditions. Simulation methods are cost- and time-effective ways to model bushfires, but ignition cause is not considered [@clarke2019developing].  These methods seldom address the ignition methods that we are interested in. <!--Therefore, simulation modelling will not be considered in our bushfire ignition research.--> 

Analytical modelling is another common way to build bushfires models. The general framework for analysing bushfires ignition is a generalised additive model (**GAM**). @bates2018exploratory used it with a Gaussian distribution for predicting the number of lightning ignitions in Warren Region, Western Australia. Some studies implemented **GAM** with a binomial distribution to predict ignition probability in New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria [@read2018lightning;@zhang2017wildfire]. Mixed-effect model is an alternative to incorporate spatial dependence and weather factors. @duff2018dryness have shown that by treating slope of drought factor and intercept vary by forest type, mixed-effect model with only 2 variables could achieve 70% mean accuracy for predicting fire occurrence in Southern Australia. Besides, simpler parametric models have also been widely used, including multiple linear regression, negative binomial regression and generalised logistic regression [@cheney2012predicting;@plucinski2014predicting;@collins2015spatial]. Instead of modelling bushfire, some research conducted statistical tests and exploratory methods to assess hypotheses about bushfire. [@miller2017electrically;@dowdy2017pyrocumulonimbus].

Common covariates for ignition analysis are weather conditions, vegetation types, topographic information and environmental impact of human activities. In addition, various fire danger indexes have been used in modelling. Some studies chose to use index variables developed by McArthur such as Forest Fire Danger Index [@clarke2019developing;@read2018lightning], while others chose to use indexes developed by the Canadian Forestry Service such as Canadian Fire Weather Index and Drought Code [@plucinski2014predicting]. We doubt that these indexes are useful for fire ignition prediction because they are extracted from weather and vegetation information. Comparing the paper written by @zumbrunnen2012human to their previous work -@zumbrunnen2011weather, fire weather index was replaced with temperature and precipitation for climate proxies, as they were available for the entire study period. Therefore, fire weather indexes will not be considered in our research given we have accessible climate data.

Throughout the review of the existing literature, we didn't find any research attempted to model the cause of the bushfire, and neither of them chose to apply hotspot data. Therefore, we intend to build a model by incorporating part of the modelling framework and covariate choices mentioned above, and use hotspot data to produce the prediction of the cause of 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season.

Although numerous studies for ignitions analysis have applied semi-parametric and parametric methods, little use of machine learning models has been made. From a predictive modelling perspective, exploiting modern algorithms to obtain better prediction performance was vital. Hence, these approaches are considered for this research.

Most of the existing work on bushfire ignition focuses on less than 3 states in Australia. Model is seldomly applied across Australia. This is mainly due to the lack of coherence in bushfire datasets provided by different states. In this research, we will also only focus on bushfires in Victoria.
