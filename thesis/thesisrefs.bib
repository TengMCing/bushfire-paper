abstract = {Morrison had won the “quiet Australians” with a pledge to safeguard the fossil fuel industry, while Labor won the cities with a promise to take decisive action on climate change. The New York Times has accused Australia’s largest media company, News Corp, and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, of attempting to influence the debate by arguing that this year’s fires are no worse than those of the past – a claim conservative members of government have since repeated and that climate scientists say is simply not true. Adding to this myth was a picture that circulated online appearing to show that the Greens party changed its policies on bushfire risk management after the bushfires started, but an archived version of the same page from March 2019 shows the policy has remained unchanged since then.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that combining multiple versions of unstable classifiers such as trees or neural nets results in reduced test set error. One of the more effective is bagging. Here, modified training sets are formed by resampling from the original training set, classifiers constructed using these training sets and then combined by voting. Freund and Schapire propose an algorithm the basis of which is to adaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym "arcing") so that the weights in the resampling are increased for those cases most often misclassified and the combining is done by weighted voting. Arcing is more successful than bagging in test set error reduction. We explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and to bagging, and try to understand how arcing works. We introduce the definitions of bias and variance for a classifier as components of the test set error. Unstable classifiers can have low bias on a large range of data sets. Their problem is high variance. Combining multiple versions either through bagging or arcing reduces variance significantly.},
