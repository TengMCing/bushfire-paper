# Introduction

In Australia, bushfires have historically caused massive loss of property and life. Since the 1967 Hobart bushfires, the insurance claims for building losses was greater than $A10 million [@mcaneney2009100]. <!-- McAneney, Chen and Pitman (2009) show in their research that the average number of buildings had been destroyed by bushfire per year is 84, accounting for 20% of total building losses in hazard events.-->
The Australian bushfire season in 2019-2020, compared with other major bushfires in history, had a more devastating impact on the environment and properties.  According to the report of @LisaRichardsNigelBrew2020 published by Parliament of Australia, 3094 houses have been destroyed and over 17M hectares of land burned in the last bushfire season. These two figures are the highest in history. Fortunately, only 33 people including firefighters died compared to 173 in the Black Saturday fires and 47 in Ash Wednesday fires [@LisaRichardsNigelBrew2020].
Understanding the cause of the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires is a crucial step to provide information for future policy and fire risk management.

The research is also motivated by the lack of knowledge about the cause of bushfire in Australia. @beale2011preventing state in their research that the cause is only known for 58.9% of fires. Historically, about 50% are due to deliberate and suspicious ignitions, 35% by accidents and 6% natural, such as lightning. Providing a probable cause for bushfires may help investigators in practice.

# Research aims and	questions

<!--Australia 2019-2020 experience one of the most devastating bushfire seasons in history. How these fires started it's an important question in order to manage future hazard events. Lightning strikes and arson were been discussed publicly. REPEAT OF WHAT IS SAID ABOVE--> This research will explore the potential methods of fire ignition during 2019-2020 Australia bushfires season based on the new availability of satellite data, and provide a model to predict the fire risk for locations around the country. Hotspots data from the JAXAâ€™s Himawari-8 satellite will be combined with weather data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and other data on roads, recreation sites, vegetation,  to study locations of fire ignition and predict bushfire risk. Satellite data provides the opportunity to more objectively study ignition locations, particularly in less accessible regions.

The overall research aim is to provide probabilistic estimates of the cause of fire ignition for the 2019-2020 bushfires. Several smaller research questions that will be addressed are:

  1. Using satellite hotspots data can we detect ignition time and location? 
  2. Can data from other sources including vegetation, weather, proximity to road and recreation site help to inform ignition type?
  3. How do the characteristics of 2019-2020 bushfires compare to historical bushfires?
  4. Can we make a useful model for the fire risk across Australia? What predictors including fire indexes, proximity to road and recreation site, weather and vegetation are useful for modelling fire risk? 


# Review of literature

Existing research on bushfire modelling can be divided into two main categories: simulation and analytical modelling. 

In simulation modelling, @keane2004classification develop landscape fire succession models (LFSMs) to simulate fire behaviour spatially, including fire ignition and fire spread, and accounting for fire and vegetation dynamics. @bradstock2012wildfires used a model called FIRESCAPE which involved simulating fire behaviours with fuel and weather conditions. Simulation methods are cost-effective and time-effective ways to model bushfires, but ignition cause is not considered [@clarke2019developing].  These methods seldomly address the ignition types that we are interested in. <!--Therefore, simulation modelling will not be considered in our bushfire ignition research.--> 

Analytical modelling is another common way to build bushfires models. The general framework for analysing bushfires ignitions is a generalised additive model (GAM). @bates2018exploratory used it with a Gaussian distribution for predicting the number of lightning ignitions. Some studies implemented GAM with a multinomial distribution to predict ignition probability [@read2018lightning;@zhang2017wildfire]. Mixed-effect models have also been considered to incorporate spatial dependence and weather factors [@duff2018dryness]. Simpler models have also been used, including multiple linear regression, negative binomial regression and generalised logistic regression [@cheney2012predicting;@plucinski2014predicting;@collins2015spatial]. Particularly, instead of using a model, some researches performed statistical testing and exploratory data analysis to test hypotheses about bushfires [@miller2017electrically;@dowdy2017pyrocumulonimbus].

Common covariates for ignition analysis are weather conditions, vegetation types, topographic information and anthropogenic variables. In addition, various fire danger indexes have been used in modelling. Some studies choose to use index variables developed by McArthur such as Forest Fire Danger Index [@clarke2019developing;@read2018lightning], while others choose to use indexes developed by Canadian Forestry Service such as Canadian Fire Weather Index and Drought Code [@plucinski2014predicting]. We doubt that these indexes are useful for fire ignition prediction because they are extracted from weather and vegetation information. However, it may help improve our model performance because it can be viewed as generated from feature engineering. 

Although numerous studies for ignitions analysis have applied semi-parametric and parametric methods, little analytics attention has been paid to more complex models like the tree-based model, support vector machine and artificial neural network. These tools are well developed in machine learning, which will also be considered for this research.

Most of the existing work on bushfire ignition cause focuses on south-eastern Australia [@clarke2019developing], and Victoria [@read2018lightning]. Models have not been applied across Australia.

# Project	design

## Data collection

A focus of this work is to utilise open-source data, and collate these data sets to provide a data fusion with which to tackle the research questions. The motivating data source is satellite hotspots, which is different from what has been analysed previously in the literature.  This data is collated with weather records, fuel layer, location of roads and recreation sites, and historical data on ignition cause. The spatial and temporal details of each dataset are provided in table \ref{tab:datasetinfo}. Descriptions and links to the data sources can be found in table \ref{tab:datadescription}. These two tables are provided in the Appendix.

## Data preprocessing

### Data types

The hotspot and weather data is in CSV format, which can be processed generally with the `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse] tools in R [@R]. Fuel layer and other map data are presented as geospatial objects, which can be processed using the tools in the `sf` [@R-sf]. 

### Identifying unique fires using spatiotemporal clustering

Hotpots are light detections from the satellite, provided at 10-minute intervals. To study ignition, it needs to be processed to identify the start, indicate the likelihood of being the same fire, and track the movement of a fire. Not all hotspots are fires, and the recommended threshold of firepower over 100 (irradiance over 100 watts per square metre) is used to filter the data. Only data recorded after the published fire restrictions dates are used. 

<!--However, just like it is hard to identify a single plant from the top view of a grassland, information about individual bushfire can not be directly derived from the raw hotspot data. In order to understand the ignition time and ignition place of each bushfire, we need to divide hotspots into clusters and trace the growth of each cluster. --> 

<!-- The initial steps in the processing were to subset to only Australian locations, keep only hotspots above a threshold firepower (irradiance over 100 watts per square metre), and set the starting time to be when annual fire restrictions were lifted.  To preprocess the hotspots data, we selected the observations in Australia from the full disk. Meanwhile, hotspots with irradiance under 100 watt per square metre will be deleted. We restricted our study to hotspots that have significant firepower. An hour id has been assigned to each observation range from 1 to T, represents the relative time the hotspot being observed.-->

A clustering algorithm was developed to identify fire clusters, and details can be found in Table \ref{tab:clustering}. Each hotspot will be assigned a cluster membership which we called *fire_id*. Other characteristics of each fire id including its centroid, starting time, ending time and movement are recorded. The motivation for this algorithm is the behaviour of real bushfire which can be summarised as two parameters, the potential distance a fire can spread in an hour, and the time a fire can stay smouldering but undetectable before flaring up again, represented by $r_0$ and $t_0$, respectively. These two parameters have been used to determine if a new hotspot belongs to an existing or new cluster.

Figure \ref{fig:mov} shows two fires and their lifetime movement as computed by the algorithm. 

### Compiled data

The end result of the data pre-processing is a set of data tables, that are uniquely identified by individual primary key and related by a set of foreign keys.  Figure \ref{fig:ERD} shows these tables and the keys which allow information to be compared across tables. Technically, this is called a conceptual entity relationship diagram (ERD). It will be useful for developing the data model to be used in both modelling and  a web interface for communicating fire risk.

## Exploratory data analysis

<!-- ### Overview of 2019-2020 Australia bushfire season

Figure \ref{fig:overview} sfsdfs-->

Preliminary examination of the compiled data to examine spatiotemporal trends and relationships between variables with be conducted using graphical and numerical summaries. 

## Modelling

Two types of models will be developed and tested. One is the ignition method prediction model, which is used for analysing ignition type of 2019-2020 bushfires and predicting the causes of future bushfires. Another is the fire risk model. It will learn the features of hotspots and predict the probability of hotspots occurrence. 

- Predicting ignition method: Historical causes of bushfires will be used as training data. Multi-class response variable models, using vegetation, topographic and climate information as independent variables, will be developed and assessed. Statistical models, generalized linear model, and generalized additive model will be compared with these computational models, random forest, support vector machine and artificial neural networks. 

- Modelling fire risk: The framework of fire risk modelling is similar to ignition method prediction. It will be a binary classification problem. This model aims to predict the probability of bushfire ignition in a cell of the grid. The grid will be designed to fit the shape of Victoria with spatial resolution equal to 50km (Figure \ref{fig:overview}). The training data will be the hotspots data instead of bushfires history. Models considered will be the same as ignition method prediction.

# Expected outcomes

It is expected that we will have probabilistic predictions for ignition cause for each of the fires identified from the hotspot data during 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season. A usable model of fire risk will be produced and made accessible in  an interactive web application.

The triangle is the ignition point of bushfire and the rectangle is the extinguish point. The black line is the movement of bushfire centroid. Points with red color and larger size are hotspots with higher firepower which is measured by watt per square metre. We can know that bushfires ignited with low firepower, and will get hotter when time pass, then finally extinguish with not enough fuel. \label{fig:mov}](figures/fire_mov.jpg){width=500px}
