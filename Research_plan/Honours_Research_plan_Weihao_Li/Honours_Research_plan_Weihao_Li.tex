\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In Australia, bushfires have historically caused massive loss of property and life. Since the 1967 Hobart bushfires, the insurance claims for building losses were greater than \$A10 million \autocite{mcaneney2009100}.
The 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, compared with other major bushfires in history, had a more devastating impact on the environment and properties. According to a report by \textcite{LisaRichardsNigelBrew2020}, published by the Parliament of Australia, 3094 houses were destroyed and over 17M hectares of land burned. These two figures are the highest in history. Fortunately, fewer lives were lost: 33 (including firefighters) compared to 173 in the Black Saturday fires and 47 in Ash Wednesday fires \autocite{LisaRichardsNigelBrew2020}.

The research is also motivated by the lack of knowledge about the cause of bushfire in Australia. \textcite{beale2011preventing} state in their research that the cause is only known for 58.9\% of fires. Historically, about 50\% are due to deliberate and suspicious ignitions, 35\% by accidents and 6\% by natural, such as lightning. Understanding the cause of the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires is a crucial step to provide information for future policy and fire risk management.

\hypertarget{research-aims-and-questions}{%
\section{Research aims and questions}\label{research-aims-and-questions}}

This research will explore the potential methods of fire ignition during 2019-2020 Australia bushfires season based on the new availability of satellite data, and provide a model to predict the fire risk for locations around the country. Satellite data provides the opportunity to more objectively study ignition locations, particularly in less accessible regions.

The overall research aim is to provide probabilistic estimates of the cause of fire ignition for the 2019-2020 bushfires. Several smaller research questions that will be addressed are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Using satellite hotspots data can we detect ignition time and location?
\item
  Can data from other sources including vegetation, weather, proximity to road and recreation sites help to inform ignition type?
\item
  How do the characteristics of 2019-2020 bushfires compare to historical bushfires?
\item
  Can we make a useful model for the fire risk across Australia? What predictors including fire indexes, proximity to road and recreation site, weather and vegetation are useful for modelling fire risk?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{review-of-literature}{%
\section{Review of literature}\label{review-of-literature}}

Existing research on bushfire modelling can be divided into two main categories: simulation and analytical modelling.

In simulation modelling, \textcite{keane2004classification} developed landscape fire succession models (LFSMs) to simulate spatial fire behaviour, including fire ignition and fire spread, and accounting for fire and vegetation dynamics. \textcite{bradstock2012wildfires} used a model called FIRESCAPE which involved simulating fire behaviours with fuel and weather conditions. Simulation methods are cost- and time-effective ways to model bushfires, but ignition cause is not considered \autocite{clarke2019developing}. These methods seldomly addressed the ignition types that we are interested in.

Analytical modelling is another common way to build bushfires models. The general framework for analysing bushfires ignition is a generalised additive model (GAM). \textcite{bates2018exploratory} used it with a Gaussian distribution for predicting the number of lightning ignitions. Some studies implemented GAM with a multinomial distribution to predict ignition probability \autocite{read2018lightning,zhang2017wildfire}. Mixed-effect models have also been considered to incorporate spatial dependence and weather factors \autocite{duff2018dryness}. Simpler models have also been used, including multiple linear regression, negative binomial regression and generalised logistic regression \autocite{cheney2012predicting,plucinski2014predicting,collins2015spatial}. Some research used statistical tests and exploratory methods to assess hypotheses about bushfires \autocite{miller2017electrically,dowdy2017pyrocumulonimbus}.

Common covariates for ignition analysis are weather conditions, vegetation types, topographic information and environmental impact of human activities. In addition, various fire danger indexes have been used in modelling. Some studies choose to use index variables developed by McArthur such as Forest Fire Danger Index \autocite{clarke2019developing,read2018lightning}, while others choose to use indexes developed by the Canadian Forestry Service such as Canadian Fire Weather Index and Drought Code \autocite{plucinski2014predicting}. We doubt that these indexes are useful for fire ignition prediction because they are extracted from weather and vegetation information. However, this type of feature engineering could improve the models.

Although numerous studies for ignitions analysis have applied semi-parametric and parametric methods, little use of machine learning models has been made. These approaches will also be considered for this research.

Most of the existing work on bushfire ignition cause focuses on south-eastern Australia \autocite{clarke2019developing}, and Victoria \autocite{read2018lightning}. Models have not been applied across Australia.

\hypertarget{project-design}{%
\section{Project design}\label{project-design}}

\hypertarget{data-collection}{%
\subsection{Data collection}\label{data-collection}}

A focus of this work is to utilise open-source data, and collate these data sets to provide a data fusion with which to tackle the research questions. The motivating data source is satellite hotspots, which is different from what has been analysed previously in the literature. This data is collated with weather records, fuel layer, location of roads and recreation sites, and historical data on ignition cause. The spatial and temporal details of each dataset are provided in Table \ref{tab:datasetinfo}. Descriptions and links to the data sources can be found in Table \ref{tab:datadescription}. These two tables are provided in the Appendix.

\hypertarget{data-pre-processing}{%
\subsection{Data pre-processing}\label{data-pre-processing}}

\hypertarget{data-types}{%
\subsubsection{Data types}\label{data-types}}

The hotspot and weather data is in CSV format, which can be processed generally with the \texttt{tidyverse} \autocite{R-tidyverse} tools in R \autocite{R}. Fuel layer and other map data are presented as geospatial objects, which can be processed using the tools in the \texttt{sf} \autocite{R-sf}.

\hypertarget{identifying-unique-fires-using-spatiotemporal-clustering}{%
\subsubsection{Identifying unique fires using spatiotemporal clustering}\label{identifying-unique-fires-using-spatiotemporal-clustering}}

Hotpots are light detections from the satellite, provided at 10-minute intervals. To study ignition, it needs to be processed to identify the start, indicate the likelihood of being the same fire, and track the movement of a fire. Not all hotspots are fires, and the recommended threshold of fire power over 100 (irradiance over 100 watts per square metre) is used to filter the data. Only data recorded after the published fire restrictions dates are used.

A clustering algorithm was developed to group hotspots into unique fires. The details are in Table \ref{tab:clustering} in the Appendix. Each hotspot will be assigned a cluster membership which is called the \emph{fire\_id}. Other characteristics of each fire, including its centroid, starting time, ending time and movement are recorded. The motivation for this algorithm is bushfire dynamics which can be summarised using two parameters, the potential distance a fire can spread in an hour, and the time a fire can stay smouldering but undetectable by satellite before flaring up again, represented by \(r_0\) and \(t_0\), respectively. These two parameters have been used to determine if a new hotspot belongs to an existing or new cluster.

Figure \ref{fig:mov} shows two fires and their lifetime movement as computed by the algorithm.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=5.20833in,height=\textheight]{figures/fire_mov.jpg}
\caption{The movement path and hotspots map shows the bushfire behaviour of bushfire ``454'' and bushfire ``1420'', which is two clusters from the results of the clustering algorithm. The triangle is the ignition point of bushfire and the rectangle is the extinguish point. The black line is the movement of bushfire centroid. Points with red color and larger size are hotspots with higher fire power which is measured by watt per square metre. We can know that bushfires ignited with low fire power, and will get hotter when time pass, then finally extinguish with not enough fuel. \label{fig:mov}}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{compiled-data}{%
\subsubsection{Compiled data}\label{compiled-data}}

The end result of the data pre-processing is a set of data tables, that are uniquely identified by an individual primary key and related by a set of foreign keys. Figure \ref{fig:ERD} summarizes these tables and the keys which allow information to be compared across tables. Technically, this is called a conceptual entity relationship diagram (ERD). It will be useful for developing the data model to be used in both modelling and a web interface for communicating fire risk.

\hypertarget{exploratory-data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Exploratory data analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}}

Preliminary examination of the compiled data to examine spatiotemporal trends and relationships between variables will be conducted using graphical and numerical summaries.

\hypertarget{modelling}{%
\subsection{Modelling}\label{modelling}}

Two types of models will be developed and tested. One is the ignition method prediction model, which is used for analysing ignition type of 2019-2020 bushfires and predicting the causes of future bushfires. Another is the fire risk model. It will learn the features of hotspots and predict the probability of a future hotspot occurring.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Predicting ignition method: Historical causes of bushfires will be used as training data. Multi-class response variable models, using vegetation, topographic and climate information as independent variables, will be developed and assessed. Statistical models, generalized linear model, and generalized additive model will be compared with these computational models, random forest, support vector machine and artificial neural networks.
\item
  Modelling fire risk: The framework of fire risk modelling is similar to the ignition method prediction, although it will be a binary classification problem. This model aims to predict the probability of bushfire ignition in the cell of a spatial grid. The grid will be designed to fit the shape of Victoria with spatial resolution equal to 50km (Figure \ref{fig:overview}). The training data will be the hotspots data instead of bushfires history. Models considered will be the same as ignition method prediction.
\end{itemize}
